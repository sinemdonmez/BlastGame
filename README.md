# BlastGame

My first project developed with Unity.
---
BlastGame is a simple puzzle game where your objective is to pop candies by matching two or more. Create powerful rockets and combos to clear rows, columns, and even entire sections of the board!


## How to Play

- **Match Candies:**  
  Click adjacent candies to form groups of three or more. When matched, the candies pop off the board.

- **Create Rockets:**  
  Matching four or more candies will spawn a rocket. When activated, a rocket clears either an entire row or an entire column.

- **Rocket Combos:**  
  Trigger a rocket combo by clicking on a rocket that is adjacent to another rocket. This creates an even more powerful blast!

- **Level Goals:**  
  Each level features special tiles that need to be broken. You can remove these tiles with rockets or by forming adjacent matches, depending on the tile.

## Future Fixes & Planned Enhancements

- **Improved Input Handling:**  
  Address issues with consecutive or overly quick clicks to ensure smoother gameplay.
