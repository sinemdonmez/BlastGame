## How to Play

- **Match Tiles:**  
  Click adjacent tiles to form groups of three or more. When matched, the tiles pop off the board.

- **Create Rockets:**  
  Matching four or more tiles will spawn a rocket. When activated, a rocket clears either an entire row or an entire column.

- **Rocket Combos:**  
  Trigger a rocket combo by clicking on a rocket that is adjacent to another rocket. This creates an even more powerful blast!

- **Level Goals:**  
  Each level features special tiles that need to be broken. You can remove these tiles with rockets or by forming adjacent matches, depending on the tile.

## Future Fixes & Planned Enhancements
